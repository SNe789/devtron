# Why Devtron?
 
Devtron is an open-source modular product that provides a `seamless` and `implementated agnostic uniform interface`, that can be integrated with both open-source and commercial tools across the entire application lifecycle.

All this is achieved while focusing on a slick user experience, including a self-serve model.

To improve the use of Kubernetes, several tools are need to be integrated. But using these tools at the same time, however, is cumbersome and complex. These tools do not communicate with one another to manage different aspects of the application lifecycle, such as CI, CD, security, cost, observability, and stabilization.
 
 This is where Devtron comes into the picture!
 With Devtron, you can efficiently handle security, stability, cost, and more in a unified experience.

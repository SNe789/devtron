# Build and Deploy

For the applications to be built and deployed on pushing a change, the build and deployment pipelines must be set to `AUTO`. On the `Build and Deploy` section of the `Application Groups`, you can trigger build or deploy more than one application at the same time. You can also `Select all apps` to trigger build or deploy all the applications.

There are two main steps for building and deploying applications:

* [Triggering CI](triggering-ci.md)

* [Triggering CD](triggering-cd.md)


## Application with pre-deployment/post deployment pipeline

The application with the pre-deployment or post-deployment pipeline can also be selected by triggering:

* [Trigger Pre-deployment stage](https://docs.devtron.ai/v/v0.6/usage/applications/creating-application/cd-pipeline#3.-pre-deployment-stage)
* [Trigger Deployment](https://docs.devtron.ai/v/v0.6/usage/applications/creating-application/cd-pipeline#4.-deployment-stage)
* [Trigger Post-deployment stage](https://docs.devtron.ai/v/v0.6/usage/applications/creating-application/cd-pipeline#5.-post-deployment-stage)
